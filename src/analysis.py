class Analysis:
    """
    This is a pipeline object that accepts a Source object
    (e.g., with some lightcurves) and performs analysis on it.
    Use pars.data_types to choose which kind of analysis
    is to be done. The default is to use photometry.
    Any sources with all-empty raw data will be skipped.
    Other sources are assumed to have reduced datasets,
    and that they already contain the data required.
    For example, a source with a lightcurve that is missing
    its data (either in RAM or from disk) will raise an exception.

    The outputs of the analysis are:
    1) Properties object, summarizing the results for each object (e.g., best S/N).
    2) Processed data (e.g., lightcurves) with quality flags and S/N, etc.
    3) Detection objects (if we find anything interesting)
    4) Updates to the histogram (counts the number of measurements
       with a specific score like S/N, specific magnitude, etc.).
    5) Simulated datasets and detections (if using injections).

    The QualityChecker object is used to scan the data and assign
    scores on various parameters, that can be used to disqualify
    parts of the data.
    For example, if the individual lightcurve RA/Dec values are
    too far from the source RA/Dec, then we can disqualify
    some data points, which will also flag the Detection objects
    that overlap those measurements.
    This uses, e.g., the "offset" quality cut.

    The Finder object then proceeds to add S/N (and other scores)
    to the processed lightcurve.
    The processed lightcurves can be saved to the database
    and to disk, or they can be removed to save space.
    Use the pars.commit_processed to toggle this behavior.

    quality_values is a histogram object is used to keep track
    of the number of measurements that are lost to each quality cut,
    so we can fine tune the cut thresholds on the QualityChecker object.
    all_scores and good_scores are used to track the number of measurements
    that end up with each score. The good_scores includes only data that
    passed all quality cuts.

    The Simulator is used to inject fake sources into the data,
    which are recovered as Detection objects.
    The injection data is calculated after posting the new
    counts into the histogram.
